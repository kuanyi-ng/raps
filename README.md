# ExaDigiT/RAPS

ExaDigiT's Resource Allocator and Power Simulator (RAPS) schedules workloads and 
estimates dynamic system power at specified time intervals. RAPS either schedules 
synthetic workloads or replays system telemetry workloads,
provides system monitoring during simulation, and an outputs a report of scheduling
and power statistics at the end of the simulation. RAPS also can interface with 
the FMU cooling model by providing CDU-level power inputs to the cooling model,
and reporting the statistics back to the user. RAPS also has built-in plotting
capabilities to generate plots of power and cooling at the end of simulation runs.
An optional RAPS dashboard is also provided, which requires also running the RAPS server.
Instructions for setup and usage are given below. An online documentation of ExaDigiT with a sub part concerning RAPS is also available [here](https://exadigit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Setup environment

Note: Requires python3.9 or greater.

    pip install -e .

## Usage and help menu

    python main.py -h

## Run simulator with default synthetic workload

    python main.py

## Run simulator with telemetry replay

    # Frontier 
    DATEDIR="date=2024-01-18"
    DPATH=~/data/frontier-sample-2024-01-18
    python main.py -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR $DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR

## Open Telemetry dataset

For Marconi supercomputer, download `job_table.parquet` from https://zenodo.org/records/10127767

    # Marconi100
    python main.py --system marconi100 -f ~/data/marconi100/job_table.parquet 

For Adastra MI250 supercomputer, download 'AdastaJobsMI250_15days.parquet' from https://zenodo.org/records/14007065

    # Adastra MI250
    python main.py --system adastraMI250 -f AdastaJobsMI250_15days.parquet 

## Snapshot of extracted workload data

To reduce the expense of extracting the needed data from the telemetry parquet files,
RAPS saves a snapshot of the extracted data in NPZ format. The NPZ file can be
given instead of the parquet files for more quickly running subsequent simulations, e.g.:

    python main.py -f jobs_2024-02-20_12-20-39.npz

## Support for multiple system partitions

Multi-partition systems are supported by running the `multi-part-sim.py` script, where a list of configurations can be specified using the `-x` flag as follows:

    python multi-part-sim.py -x setonix/part-cpu setonix/part-gpu

or simply:

    python multi-part-sim.py -x setonix/* # bash

    python multi-part-sim.py -x 'setonix/*' # zsh

This will simulate synthetic workloads on two partitions as defined in `config/setonix-cpu` and `config/setonix-gpu`. To replay telemetry workloads from another system, e.g., Marconi100's PM100 dataset, first create a .npz snapshot of the telemetry data, e.g., 

    python main.py --system marconi100 -f /path/to/marconi100/job_table.parquet

This will dump a .npz file with a randomized name, e.g. ac23db.npz. Let's rename this file to pm100.npz for clarity. Note: can control-C when the simulation starts. Now, this pm100.npz file can be used with `multi-part-sim.py` as follows:

    python multi-part-sim.py -x setonix/* -f pm100.npz --reschedule poisson --scale 192

The `--reschedule` flag will use the internal scheduler to determine what nodes to schedule for each job, and the `--scale` flag will specify the maximum number of nodes for each job (generally set this to the max number of nodes of the smallest partition). 

## Job-level power output example for replay of single job

    python main.py -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR $DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR --jid 1234567 -o

## Compute stats on telemetry data, e.g., average job arrival time

    python -m raps.telemetry -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR $DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR

## Build and run Docker container

    make docker_build && make docker_run
