# ExaDigiT/RAPS

ExaDigiT's Resource Allocator and Power Simulator (RAPS) schedules workloads and 
estimates dynamic system power at specified time intervals. RAPS either schedules 
synthetic workloads or replays system telemetry workloads,
provides system monitoring during simulation, and an outputs a report of scheduling
and power statistics at the end of the simulation. RAPS also can interface with 
the FMU cooling model by providing CDU-level power inputs to the cooling model,
and reporting the statistics back to the user. RAPS also has built-in plotting
capabilities to generate plots of power and cooling at the end of simulation runs.
An optional RAPS dashboard is also provided, which requires also running the RAPS server.
Instructions for setup and usage are given below. 

## Setup environment

Note: Requires python3.9 or greater.

    pip install -e .

## Usage and help menu

    python main.py -h

## Run simulator with default synthetic workload

    python main.py

## Run simulator with telemetry replay

    # Frontier 
    DATEDIR="date=2024-01-18"
    DPATH=~/data/frontier-sample-2024-01-18
    python main.py -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR $DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR

## Open Telemetry dataset

For Marconi supercomputer, download `job_table.parquet` from https://zenodo.org/records/10127767

    # Marconi100
    python main.py --system marconi100 -f ~/data/marconi100/job_table.parquet 

For Adastra MI250 supercomputer, download 'AdastaJobsMI250_15days.parquet' from https://zenodo.org/records/14007065
    # Adastra MI250
    python main.py --system adastraMI250 -f AdastaJobsMI250_15days.parquet 


## Snapshot of extracted workload data

To reduce the expense of extracting the needed data from the telemetry parquet files,
RAPS saves a snapshot of the extracted data in NPZ format. The NPZ file can be
given instead of the parquet files for more quickly running subsequent simulations, e.g.:

    python main.py -f jobs_2024-02-20_12-20-39.npz

## Job-level power output example for replay of single job

    python main.py -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR $DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR --jid 1234567 -o

## Compute stats on telemetry data, e.g., average job arrival time

    python -m raps.telemetry -f $DPATH/slurm/joblive/$DATEDIR $DPATH/jobprofile/$DATEDIR

## Build and run Docker container

    make docker_build && make docker_run
